babioon-caption
===============

A different approach to add a caption to an image in joomla!


This content plugin can be used to add a caption to an image instead of adding the caption with javascript. 


Makes sense for Joomla 2.5.x but I don't see so much sense for 3.x. Last Version is 2.0.1 tested with 2.5.27.
